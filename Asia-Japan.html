            <h2>KOREA</h2>
            <!--<p>cinema is our passion</p>-->

          <p>When we hear Korea, the fact that automatically comes to our mind is North Korea v/s South Korea and how contrasting they are. Here also, we will discuss the Cinema cultures of North and South Korea, how they represent themselves, and how they differ. 

            According to the world, South Korean cinema is generally considered superior to North Korean cinema. 
            South Korean films are much more diverse and feature a variety of genres, including comedy, romance, action, horror, and science fiction. They often feature complex narratives and explore identity, family, and historical themes. They are also unafraid to challenge traditional gender roles and social norms through their films. Owing to this, South Korean movies have become increasingly popular internationally and have won numerous awards for their quality. 
            Some examples of world-famous South Korean films include "Parasite" (2019), in which a poor family schemes to become employed by a wealthy family by infiltrating their household and posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.,
             Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds (2017) shows a firefighter who dies in the line of duty and is sent to the afterlife, where he must pass seven trials to be reincarnated. 
            Extreme Job (2019) and Along with the Gods: The Last 49 Days (2018). These films have become highly acclaimed internationally, with "Parasite" winning the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2020.
            
            In addition to this, LGBTQ films and representations of LGBTQ characters in South Korean cinema can be seen since the beginning of South Korean cinema despite public perceptions of South Korea as largely anti-LGBT. Though queer Korean cinema has mainly been represented through independent films and short films, there exists a push for the inclusion of LGBTQ representation in the cinema as well as a call for attention to these films. 
            Founded in 1996, the Busan International Film Festival is South Korea's major film festival. It has become one of Asia's largest and most prestigious film events, increasing its popularity globally.
            
            
            On the contrary, the film industry in North Korea is tightly controlled by the government and is used as a tool for propaganda. Films produced in the country typically focus on themes of patriotism and loyalty to the ruling regime. Their movies often depict the country's leaders in a positive light and portray the North Korean people as strong and unified. Themes of family values, self-sacrifice, and honor are often featured in their films. They also focus on depicting the "evil" of other countries, particularly the United States and South Korea.
            They express their anti-American sentiment by portraying the United States as a criminal, imperialist force. Films may depict the United States as a hostile power bent on controlling the Korean peninsula and oppressing the North Korean people.
            Their films encouraged things like eating potatoes to cope with food shortages, not abandoning rural hometowns, and of course â€“ loving the Great Leader.
            
            Some examples of North Korean films that feature propaganda include "The Flower Girl" (1972); this film tells the story of a poor girl who can rise out of poverty with the help of the North Korean government. Other examples include "Sea of Blood" (1968), which depicts the cruelty of the Japanese occupation of Korea, "Unsung Heroes" (1969), which portrays the brave North Korean soldiers who fought in the Korean War, some more like "A Nation's Destiny" (1985), etc.
            All of this conveys their poles apart cinema scenario. It can be surprising to see how once a united nation could evolve into such contrasting values nations. Now, both countries express their views, opinions, and identity to the world uniquely, and cinema is one of the significant ways.
